# BIO 2021

This [paper from 2021](https://olympiad.org.uk/papers/2021/bio/round_one.html) is a classic of the genre. 

In this repo I've started a project which includes a class and some tests. Please put the code for your answers in a class for each of the three questions. You can follow my lead or start from scratch. 

## Question 1 - short and sharp 

As normal, Q1 is reasonably approachable, but be sure to read the question carefully there cam sometimes be some edge cases that might cause trouble to the unwary. 

## Question 2 - all about the setup 

Q2 is all about the grunt work, it can often take a lot of work - and classes can be useful here - but again, is often very doable once you've put all the pieces into place. 

## Question 3 - huge number of possibilities 

Q3 is often quite easy for small cases, but will grow very time consuming for poorly considered solutions, can you see the short cut to avoid a brute force method?
